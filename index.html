              You may use <strong>any methods at your disposal</strong> within the room.
            You're allowed to Google things if you think you need to, at your own discretion - but it probably won't help much.

              <strong>Hints are available for each puzzle</strong>.
            Each puzzle is labelled on the back with which hint belongs to it.
            <!-- If there's more than one hint for a puzzle, use them in order. -->
            Each hint will <strong>add an extra minute to your time</strong>.

              Any incorrect guesses will <strong>add an extra minute to your time</strong>.
